# Possible Designators

(copied from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_designator> and edited lightly)

This is a list of all components that Schemascii *might* support. For a complete list of all supported components, (generated from the implementation file), please see [supported-components.md](./supported-components.md). If a component you want is not supported, have a look at [#3](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/schemascii/issues/3) or fork and implement it yourself.
