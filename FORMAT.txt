The diagram is made of 3 components: wires, 1-, 2-, and 3-terminal components, and larger components (IC's, etc.) drawn as boxes.

Wires are simply lines drawn using dashes or pipe symbols. A wire join (drawn as a dot) is notated by a lowercase o, and crossed wires (not 
joined) are notated with a ")". A wire corner is an "*" (asterisk). Examples:

Valid, crossed:      Valid, joined:      Wire corner:         Invalid:       Invalid:      Invalid:
        |                    |                  |                 |              |             |
     ---)---              ---o---               *---           -------        ---|---       ---*---
        |                    |                                    |              |             |

Small components are notated with one or more uppercase letters followed by an ID number. They are always written horizontally even if the
terminals are on the top and bottom. IDs are allowed to be duplicated and result in the same component values.

Examples:
R2
C33
Q1001
L51
FB3
D7

1-, 2-, and 3-terminal components are able to accept "flags", which are other punctuation characters and lowercase letters touching them.
Polarized components (caps, diodes, etc.) accept a "+" to indicate the polarity, whereas transistors use "^><v" to indicate collector
(pointing in) and emitter (pointing out).

Big components are indicated with a box amde of "~" (top and bottom), ":" (sides), and "." (corners). The inside of the box can be anything you
want, but it must include a "small component"-style note as to what component it is.
